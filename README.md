# CityDriverGame

City Driver Game is an endless runner game set in a futuristic cyberpunk-themed environment. Take control of a futuristic-themed car and navigate through a dynamically generated map filled with obstacles and coins. The objective of the game is to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding collisions with obstacles. The game features a main menu screen, infinite generating map with three lanes, character movement mechanics, obstacle and coin placement, and a game over screen.

## Features
- Main Menu Screen: The game starts with a main menu screen where players are greeted with the game title and presented with options to start the game or quit.
 Infinite Generating Map: The game features an infinite generating map with three unique lanes. Each lane is populated with dynamically placed obstacles and coins. The road tiles are continuously generated to provide an endless driving experience.
- Player Character Class: The player controls a futuristic car using simple mechanics. The character can move left or right within the lanes and jump. The camera follows the character at a fixed distance.
- Obstacle and Coin Placement: Obstacles and coins are randomly placed on each lane. The obstacles include small and large obstacles, with the player being able to jump over small obstacles but needing to switch lanes to avoid large obstacles. Coins can be collected by colliding with them.
- Game HUD: During gameplay, a Heads-Up Display (HUD) is displayed, showing the number of coins collected and the remaining lives. The HUD also includes a pause button for players to pause the game.
